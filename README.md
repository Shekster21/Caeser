# Caeser
<h3>Intro</h3>
<pre>This is a simple python program to encrypt and  decrypt your text documents using Caeser Cipher ,
one of the oldest and simplest ciphers in existence. It is a simple substitution Cipher . In this 
implementation I have used the first 256 characters of the Unicode Character Encoding. 
The program is written in python version 3.6.5.
<pre>
<h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
<pre>
The program is run by opening the <em>caeser_crypt.py</em> file using python interpreter.
You have to tell the program whether you want to encrypt('E') or decrypt('D')  the file 
using the appropriate letter.

<strong>Encrypting:</strong>
You have to provide a relative or absolute path of the document to be encrypted.
Yo also have to provide path for the output file.
If the program is executed properly , you will get a message giving you the shift
 key(which is randomly chosen by the program) .

<strong>Decryption:</strong>
You have to provide the path of the file to be decrypted and the path of the file to 
store the output . You have to input the key output during encryption.
