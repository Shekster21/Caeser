# Caeser
###Intro###
This is a simple python program to encrypt and  decrypt your text documents using Caeser Cipher ,
one of the oldest and simplest ciphers in existence. It is a simple substitution Cipher . In this 
implementation I have used the first 256 characters of the Unicode Character Encoding. 
The program is written in python version 3.6.5.

###Instructions for Use###

The program is run by opening the *caeser_crypt.py* file using python interpreter.
You have to tell the program whether you want to encrypt('E') or decrypt('D')  the file 
using the appropriate letter.

####Encrypting:####
You have to provide a relative or absolute path of the document to be encrypted.
Yo also have to provide path for the output file.
If the program is executed properly , you will get a message giving you the shift
 key(which is randomly chosen by the program) .

####Decryption:####
You have to provide the path of the file to be decrypted and the path of the file to 
store the output . You have to input the key output during encryption.
